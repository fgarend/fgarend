<br />

A Software Engineer based in Brazil and a enthusiastic learner who enjoys building solutions, self-improvement, and embracing challenges.

## Technologies I've worked with

For most of my career, my main focus has been within the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, building solutions with Node.js on the backend and React on the frontend. In the past year, Iâ€™ve contributed to SQL ETL pipelines, leveraged AWS cloud services, and made small updates to tools written in Go.

At the beginning of my career, I worked on a large C++ codebase for a CAD software, and later contributed to a Chromium fork where I implemented new features related to the BML standard.

Since then, Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to work with a wide range of technologies, including Java, Python, Shell Script, Kong API Gateway, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Node.js FaaS, and Jira, and many more along the way that helped me broaden my experience across different areas of software development.
